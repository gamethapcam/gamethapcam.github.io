In order to write readable code, easily maintainable code, we will read about some interesting websites:

    - Get rid of switch statements --> Use Object literal (in Javascript) or use Map.

    - Make our conditional descriptive --> Use function to make our complicated conditions easy readable, understandable.

    - Use guard clauses to avoid nested if statements --> Use early return to make our code easy to read.

    - Avoid code duplication.

    - Functions should only do one thing.

    Use Chain of Responsibility to make our conditionals such as if-else statements easy to maintain by separating each conditional to each subclass of Handler - parent class.

    A problem happens when we split our conditionals is that we have to share data context between subclass handlers.
