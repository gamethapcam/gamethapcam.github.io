In this article, we will concentrate about some interesting courses that we need to learn to improve our coding quality.

Let's get started.

## Courses about Principles

1. [Encapsulation and SOLID by Mark Seemann](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/encapsulation-solid/table-of-contents)

2. [SOLID Software Design Principles in Java by Dan Geabunea](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/solid-software-design-principles-java/table-of-contents)

## Courses about Design patterns

1. [Implementing Design Patterns Using Java 8 Lambda by Jose Paumard](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/implementing-design-patterns-java-8-lambda-expression/table-of-contents)

2. [Mastering Object-oriented Programming in Java by Zoran Horvat](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/object-oriented-programming-java/table-of-contents)

    This course is very good to organize our classes in the project.

    We have the table of content of this course:
    - Staying Focused on Domain Logic with Streams

        It will talk about the problem of loop, understanding aggregation functions, generalizing selection of a single object, and generalizing the stream of objects.

    - Untangling Operations from Structure on Business Data

        It introduces about composite objects, and its limitations, design functions that support composition, make the composition algorithm explicit.

    - Advancing to a Domain - Specific Language

    - Increasing Flexibility by Removing Enums and Switch Statements

    - Turning Chained Branching into the Chain of Rule Objects

3. [Patterns for Building Distributed Systems for The Enterprise by Michael Perry](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/cqrs-theory-practice/table-of-contents)

    This course will cover about some architecture patterns such as Domain Driven Design, CQRS, Service Bus.

4. [Java: Refactoring to Design Patterns](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-refactoring-design-patterns/table-of-contents)

    - Better Object Creation with Factories

    - Eliminating Conditional Complexity

        This section will refactor conditional complexity by using Strategy pattern, and functional programming.

    - Improving Interfaces with Wrappers

        It talks about some structural patterns such as Adapter, Decorator, and Facade.

5. [Design Patterns Library](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/patterns-library/table-of-contents)

    Beside using GoF design patters, we can see some other patterns:
    - Event Aggregator
    - Lazy Load pattern
    - Service Locator pattern
    - Unit of Work
    - Rules pattern
    - Specification pattern

6. [Design Patterns in Java: Creational by Bryan Hansen](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/design-patterns-java-creational/table-of-contents)

12. [Design Patterns On-Ramp by Jeremy Clark](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/design-patterns-on-ramp/table-of-contents)

    This course will give us the real usage of patterns:
    - Observer pattern
    - Proxy pattern
    - Iterator pattern
    - Chain of Responsibility
    - Facade pattern
    - Factory Method pattern
    - Decorator pattern
