## Given problem

On 6 August 1991, the World Wide Web became publicly available. It's exactly twenty years ago. From this time, traffic data between computers on over the world has increased rapidly.

We can get an example about how the data is large at the moment. We easily know that Facebook is a giant company created social network that is utilizing by billion users on the world. With only one click on Google website, we can find that its system processes 2.5 billion pieces of content and 500+ terabytes of data each day. It's pulling in 2.7 billion Like actions and 300 million photos per day, and it scans roughly 105 terabytes of data each half hour.

It's very huge numbers on statistics. So the challenge is the traditional tools are poorly equipped to deal with the scale and complexity of much of this data.

If we use vertical scalability, we do not process all that data in limited time. Then, easily we need to use horizonal scalability means that we should combine multiple commodity computers to process that data.

So, the large distributed system was born.
