## VGA
VGA is an acronym of **Video Graphics Array**, and is a graphics standard for video display controller first introduced with the IBM PS/2 line of computers in 1987.

It allowed for a display resolution of 640x480 pixels. Since then, many revisions of the standard have been introduced. The most common is Super VGA (SVGA), which allows for resolutions greater than 640x480, such as 800x600 or 1024x768.

A standard VGA connection has 15 pins and is shaped like a trapezoid. Each line has 5 pins. The 15-pin VGA connector was provided on many video cards, computer monitors, laptor computers, projectors, and high definition television sets.

Many devices still include VGA connectors, although VGA generally coexisted with DVI as well as the newer and more compact HDMI and Display Port interface connectors.
