## Solution with zipping operators

Zipping allows you to take an emitted value from each Observable source and combine them into a single emission. Each Observable can emit a different type, but you can combine these different emitted types into a single emission.

- Observable.zip() factory method

    An emission from one Observable must wait to get paired with an emission from the other Observable. If one Observable calls onComplete() and the other still has emissions waiting to get paired, those emissions will simply be dropped, since they have nothing to be paired with.

    You can pass up to nine Observable instances to the Observable.zip() factory. If you need more than that, you can pass an Iterable<Observable<T>> or use zipArray() to provide an Observable[] array. Note that if one or more sources are producing emissions faster than another, zip() will queue up those rapid emissions as they wait on the slower source to provide emissions. This could cause undesirable performance issues as each source queues in memory. If you only care about zipping the latest emission from each source rather than catching up an entire queue, you will want to use combineLatest().

    Use Observable.zipIterable() to pass a boolean delayError argument to delay errors until all sources terminate and int bufferSize to hint at an expected number of elements from each source for queue size optimization. You may specify the latter to increase performance in certain scenarios by buffering emissions before they are zipped.
