## Solution with Combining the latest operators

The Observable.combineLatest() factory is somewhat similar to zip(), but for every emission that fires from one of the sources, it will immediately couple up with the latest emission from every other source. It will not queue up unpaired emissions for each source, but rather cache and pair the latest one.


1. Observable.combineLatest() factory method

    In simpler terms, when one source fires, it couples with the latest emissions from the others. The Observable.combineLatest() operator is especially helpful in combining UI inputs, as previous user inputs are frequently irrelevant and only the latest is of concern.

2. Observable.withLatestFrom() method

    Similar to Observable.combineLatest(), but not exactly the same, is the withLatestFrom() operator. This will map each T emission with the latest values from other observables and combine them, but it will only take one emission from each of the other observables.

    You can pass up to four Observable instances of any type to withLatestFrom(). If you need more than that, you can pass them as Iterable<Observable<T>>.
