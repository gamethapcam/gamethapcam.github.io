## Given problem






<br>

## Solution of Thread Scheduler




1. Preemptive scheduling



2. Time slicing scheduling




<br>

## Some scheduling algorithms that we need to know

2. Round-robin algorithm




3. LCFS - Last come, last served




4. SJF - Shortest Job First




5. SRTF - Shortest Remaining Time First




6. Adaptive multilevel queue
