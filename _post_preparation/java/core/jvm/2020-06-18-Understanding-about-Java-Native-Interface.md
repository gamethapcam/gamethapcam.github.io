## Applications and Examples

- Run threads in Java

    When we call **start()** method, that thread will be run. When we take closer look at the source code of the **start()** method, we will see that it eventually calls a private method called **start0()**, which itself is a **native** method. It's implemented in the Java Native Interface, specific to the host operating system.
