## Solution with Message Passing concept

1. History

    Alan Kay (born May 17, 1940) is an American computer scientist. He coined the term **object oriented programming** at grad school in 1966 or 1967. But he recognized about a mistake when using **objects** keyword.

    ```
    I'm sorry that I long ago coined the term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea. The big idea is messaging.
    ```

    According to Alan Kay's statements in this [link](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en), we can find that the meaning of OOP:

    ```
    OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.
    ```

    So belows are some important properties of OOP that Alan Kay suggests:
    - Message Passing
    - Encapsulation

        About encapsulation concept, we can read up on the article [Encapsulation in Object Oriented Programming](https://ducmanhphan.github.io/2019-12-19-encapsulation-in-object-oriented-programming)

    - Dynamic Binding

        It can also be called Late binding concept.
