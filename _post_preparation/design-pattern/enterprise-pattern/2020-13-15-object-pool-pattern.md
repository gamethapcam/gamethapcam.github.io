## Given Problem

In our program, 





<br>

## Solution of Object Pool Pattern






<br>

## When to use

- When create object has too expensive cost.
- When the frequence to creat objects is high.
- When the number of objects in use is small.


<br>

## Benefits & Drawbacks

1. Benefits

    - Boot performance of system when we can reuse objects of pool because creating object is too expensive.
    - 




2. Drawbacks





<br>

## Code C++ /Java / Javascript



<br>

## Application & Examples

- Use this pattern to manage resources such as connections to database because it is an expensive operation, and when there are too many connections opened, it will takes longer to create a new one, the database server will become overloaded; or threads.


<br>

## Wrapping up
