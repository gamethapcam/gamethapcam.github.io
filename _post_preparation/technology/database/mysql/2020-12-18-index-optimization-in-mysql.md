Before we dive into how optimize index in MySQL, we need to understand the basis about index of MySQL, then we can read the article [How to use indexes in MySQL](https://gamethapcam.github.io/2020-04-18-How-to-use-indexes-in-MySQL/). Let's get started.

- An index contains values from one or more columns in a table. If we index more than one column, the column order is very important, because MySQL can only search efficiently on a leftmost prefix of the index. Creating an index on two columns is not the same as creating two seperate single-column indexes.

- In MySQL, indexes perform more efficient when your join have the same data type and size.

- In MySQL, stored procedure is used when a query is frequently used and have no data change. Hence, using a stored procedure will be more efficient.
