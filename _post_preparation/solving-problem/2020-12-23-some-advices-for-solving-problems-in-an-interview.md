## Some advices for represent a problem in an interview

How many LeetCode questions should a new software engineer (who just graduated) solve to be **100% interview ready** for Google/Facebook?

I have had multiple interviews with google and want to start by sharing the best way I believe you should prepare for this process. First, I want to start off by saying I never met anybody that felt they were 100% ready for an interview, there are just too many questions out there that you can get asked. What you should focus on is getting comfortable with a programming language of your choice (recommend python) and being able to identify when a problem requires one of the following data structures and solve the problem using it.

- Strings
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Heaps
- Stacks
- Queues
- Sets
- Hashmaps
- Trees and Heaps
- Graphs

I will also strongly suggest you get comfortable with the following concepts.
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Approaches
- DFS and BFS (for both Trees and graphs)

The most important thing that people miss when they are interviewing is explaining to the interviewer how they are approaching the problem. The best way to answer a question would be to do it in the following steps.
- Understand - don't jump straight to implementation make sure you understand the problem by coming up with your own inputs and outputs, this is a good time to think about the edge cases. The interviewer would be more than happy at helping you understand the problem at this stage and this will save you a lot of time down the road. **A problem well stated is a problem half-solved** â€” Charles Kettering.

- Match - explain to the interviewer all the data structures you need to solve the problem

- Plan - Explain how you would solve the problem. The interviewer would usually give you hints if you explain to him how you are planning on solving the problem and this can save you some time.

- Implement - Write the code in the language of choice

- Recheck- make sure your code passes all the inputs you created in step 1. in this step you are also debugging your code.

- Evaluate- give the runtime and space usage of your code.

Make sure you don't skip any of the steps you don't want the interviewer to not know what you are doing. I want to thank Codepath for teaching me this process, it is a free course over the summer which teaches you how to ace interviews. Also, be able to solve the problem in 45 minutes.

You, usually, get quite comfortable with this process if you do about 200 Leetcode problems. I strongly suggest you solve all these problems.

Hope that helps best of Luck.
