## Advantages of Node.js
- Node.js uses one language - Javascript, to develop application. So, it will reduce human resources when compared with some projects that uses many languages in both front-end, back-end.

- Generally, Node.js is safer than PHP, mainly because we only need to compile project into index.js, then pass environment configuration parameters into this file, instead of using configuration file.

- In UI, there is only javascript code. Then, we will call API functions through AJAX. We only called API to get data, we do not fear somebody to read code when pushed code into ```public``` directory. ```public``` directory only run static website, and these APIs can used for both mobile and web. Utilizing API will be safer than using server render content.
