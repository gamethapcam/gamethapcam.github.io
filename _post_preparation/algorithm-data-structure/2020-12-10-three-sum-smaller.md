## Given problem

Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with **0 <= i < j < k < n** that satisfy the condition **nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target**.


```
Example:

Input: nums = [-2,0,1,3], and target = 2
Output: 2 
Explanation: Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:
             [-2,0,1]
             [-2,0,3]
```
