## Given problem

We have a coin collection that contains N circle coins (N > 2), the ith coin has radius ```r[i]``` that is float number and positive. **We want to arrange them into a circle**, two adjacency coin is touched each other. Then it must exist a (n + 1)th coin that if we put it into our circle, it will be touched to the other coins.

How to calculate the radius of that coin?

For example:

```
Input: N = 4, r[1] = r[2] = r[3] = r[4] = 2
Output: r[5] = 0.8284
```
